# My Dismath Portfolio
dismathportfolio-itstakzz created by Classroom for GitHub
# Week 1
* I learned what Dismath is all about because Sir Melvin Cabatuan told us about it.
* Its about thinking logically which is hard when you're new.
* I learned about logical connectives and I learned about prepositions.

| Logical symbols | Logical Connective | Usage         |
| :-----------:   | :-------------:   | :-------------: |
|  ¬         | Negation  | not |
| ∧  | Conjunction  | and |
|∨	|Disjunction|	or|
|⊕	|Exclusive disjunction	|xor|
|→|	Conditional|	if, then & only if|
|⇔	|iconditional	|iff|

# Week 2
* I learned about logical equivalances and how to use them to prove statements

|Logical Equivalence	|       |          |
| :-----------:   | :-------------:   | :-------------: |
|Commutative|	p ∧ q ⇐⇒ q ∧ p	|p ∨ q ⇐⇒ q ∨ p|
|Associative|(p ∧ q) ∧ r ⇐⇒ p ∧ (q ∧ r)	|(p ∨ q) ∨ r ⇐⇒ p ∨ (q ∨ r)|
|Distributive|	p ∧ (q ∨ r) ⇐⇒ (p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ r)	p| ∨ (q ∧ r) ⇐⇒ (p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ r)|
|Identity|	p ∧ T ⇐⇒ p|p ∨ F ⇐⇒ p|
|Negation	|p∨ ∼ p ⇐⇒ T	|p∧ ∼ p ⇐⇒ F|
|Double Negative|	∼ (∼ p) ⇐⇒ p	| |
|Idempotent|	p ∧ p ⇐⇒ p	|p ∨ p ⇐⇒ p|
|Universal Bound|	p ∨ T ⇐⇒ T	|p ∧ F ⇐⇒ F|
|De Morgan’s|	∼ (p ∧ q) ⇐⇒ (∼ p) ∨ (∼ q) | ∼ (p ∨ q) ⇐⇒ (∼ p) ∧ (∼ q)|
|Absorption|	p ∨ (p ∧ q) ⇐⇒ p|	p ∧ (p ∨ q) ⇐⇒ p|
|Conditional|	(p ⇒ q) ⇐⇒ (∼ p ∨ q)	|∼ (p ⇒ q) ⇐⇒ (p∧ ∼ q)|

* I also learned about Universal and Existential quantifiers.

# Week 3
* I learned about arguments and if its valid or if its a fallacy.
* I also learned about different type of proofs.Like Vacuous and Trivial proof.

# Week 4
* I learned about mathematical Induction
* I also learned how to use proof of equivalence

# Week 5 
* I did some excercise on recurisve algorithm to review for the quiz
* I also learned about power series

# Week 6
* I learned about sets and sets operations
* I also learne about functions
* the cardinalities of sets
* injective, surjective and bijection

# Week 7 
*  we had a call of beause of the quiz

# Week 8
* I learned about algorithms and Pseudo codes
* Searching alogirthms binary and linear

# Week 9
* I learned about sorting algorithms like bubble sort and insert sort
* also learned about time comlexity of an algorithm
* the Big O and big omega and big theta

# Week 10
* we learned about graph theory and different theorems
* Handshake theorem
* Euler circuits and paths
* Hamilton circuits and paths
* planar graphs
* and homeorphic graphs

# Week 11
* WE learned about graph coloring and trees 
* Modeling computation and turing machines.
